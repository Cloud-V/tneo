# TNeo: a real-time kernel (RTOS)

TNeo is a compact and fast real-time kernel for embedded 32/16 bits
microprocessors. It performs a preemptive priority-based scheduling and a
round-robin scheduling for the tasks with identical priority.

In addition to its already available architectures, we have added support for the [dwarfRV32](https://github.com/Cloud-V/dwarfRV32) CPU.

Comprehensive documentation is available in two forms: html and pdf.

  * Latest stable TNeo: [html](https://dfrank.bitbucket.io/tneokernel_api/latest/html/), [pdf](https://dfrank.bitbucket.io/tneokernel_api/latest/latex/tneo.pdf)
  * Current development TNeo BETA: [html](https://dfrank.bitbucket.io/tneokernel_api/dev/html/), [pdf](https://dfrank.bitbucket.io/tneokernel_api/dev/latex/tneo.pdf)
  * [Changelog](https://dfrank.bitbucket.io/tneokernel_api/dev/html/changelog.html)

Though do note we have addded this macro to register ISRs:

```c++
tn_rv32_soft_isr() // macro for registering external  interrupt handlers
```
